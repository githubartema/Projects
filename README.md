Here is my main folder, where you can find my projects:

BloodModel - imitation of blood cell movement in vessels to collect statistics.

AppForDelivery - I took part in student command competition, where the task was to create a system that supports food ordering, warehouse emulation and delivery. I was responsible for delivery app for mobiles, that supports Google Maps API, tracking of a Delivery person and server interactions. Here it is.

CNNetwork - A batch with convolutional neural network that differs cats from dogs, using three convolutional and three linear layers with different optimizations. The dataset is taken from Kaggle. Moreover, there is file with trained parameters.

WineClassification - research in wine classification field. Main tasks was to explore data as deep as possible and to propose some models, that can predict wine quality, basing on the research. The models are SVM and Neural Network.
